Certainly! Analyzing NYC 311 requests can provide valuable insights. Let's dive into the details.

### Data Analysis of NYC 311 Noise Complaints

In this project, we explore noise complaints in New York City (NYC) before and during the pandemic. The goal is to understand the rise in noise complaints, prevalent noise types, and locations with the highest noise pollution. Here are the key takeaways:

1. **Variation in Complaint Volumes:**
   - Data regarding residential noise complaint volumes in NYC varies significantly between 2019, 2020, and 2021.
   - We observe a surge in noise complaints during the 2020 lockdown period.

2. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - We use the Kruskal-Wallis test to assess the rise in noise complaints.
   - The Bronx has the quickest response time despite having the largest complaint volume.

3. **Types of Noise:**
   - We identify which types of noise are most prevalent.
   - Complaints related to outdoor noise sources (e.g., manufacturing, construction, lawn equipment) have longer resolution times (> 70 hours).

4. **Data Collection:**
   - We analyze a subset of the 27 million service requests logged in the NYC311â€™s Service Requests from 2010-Present dataset.
   - The dataset includes information about location, time, complaint type, and status of service requests.
   - We focus on the years 2019-2021.

5. **Objective:**
   - Our insights can inform data-driven efforts by the city government to better handle noise complaints and retain NYC residents.
